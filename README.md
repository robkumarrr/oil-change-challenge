# 🛠 The Vehikl Oil Change Challenge

## Objective

Create a small Laravel app that helps determine whether a car is due for an oil change based on odometer and date inputs.

A car needs an oil change if either of the following is true:
- It's been more than 5000 km since the last oil change, or
- It's been more than 6 months since the last oil change.

## Requirements

### 1. Setup
- Use Laravel 12 with a SQLite database for storing data
- Use Blade templates for the views
- Make an initial git commit immediately after setting up Laravel (before starting your work)

### 2. Form Page
- Create a form with the following fields:
    - Current Odometer
    - Date of Previous Oil Change
    - Odometer at Previous Oil Change
- Validate the input:
    - All fields are required
    - The current odometer must be greater or equal to the odometer at previous oil change
    - Date of previous oil change must be valid and in the past

### 3. Result Page
- When the form is submitted:
    - Save the form input to the database
    - Direct the user to a results page unique to that form submission
    - Display a message indicating whether the car is due for an oil change or not
    - Display the original values that were entered in the form
    - The message and original input should remain visible even if the browser is refreshed (because it's stored in the database and the user is on a result page unique to that submission)

### 4. Navigation
- Include a button or link to go back to the original (blank) form to check another car
- Do not implement user accounts, authentication, or any index/list of past checks
- Do not worry about deleting records

### 5. Frontend
- Use Blade templates for the views
- Keep it simple — no JavaScript or frontend frameworks required
- A very basic layout and design is fine

### 6. Suggested Routes
- `GET /` → Show the form
- `POST /check` → Handle submission
- `GET /result/{id}` → Show the result
